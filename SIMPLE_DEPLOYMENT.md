## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps (Railway - Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
```bash
# Make sure you have the simplified files
# (I've created main_simple.py and requirements_simple.txt)

# Commit and push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Stateless deployment ready"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login with GitHub"
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your `monopoly-deal-analyzer` repository
6. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect it's a Python app
   - Install dependencies from `requirements_simple.txt`
   - Start the app with `main_simple.py`
   - Give you a live URL

### Step 3: Test Your Deployment
1. **Visit your Railway URL** (something like `https://monopoly-deal-analyzer-production.up.railway.app`)
2. **Test the API**:
   - `/health` - Should return "healthy"
   - `/api/v1/configuration/test` - Should show configuration system working
   - `/api/v1/configuration/presets` - Should return 4 presets
3. **Test the frontend** (if Railway deployed it) or deploy separately to Vercel

### Step 4: Optional - Deploy Frontend to Vercel
If Railway only deployed the backend:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. "New Project" â†’ Import your GitHub repo
3. Set **Root Directory**: `frontend`
4. Add **Environment Variable**: 
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
   ```
5. Deploy
