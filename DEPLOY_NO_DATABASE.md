## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you're using the simplified files:
# backend/main_simple.py (not main.py)
# backend/requirements_simple.txt (not requirements.txt)
```

**CORS errors:**
```bash
# The simplified backend allows all common domains
# Check that your frontend URL is included in CORS settings
```

**Build failures:**
```bash
# Check Railway/Vercel build logs
# Ensure all files are committed to GitHub
# Verify Python/Node versions are compatible
```

### Getting Help:

1. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Railway: Project → Deployments → View logs
   - Vercel: Project → Functions → View logs

2. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main_simple.py
   # Should start on http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Community Support**
   - Railway Discord: [discord.gg/railway](https://discord.gg/railway)
