# Implementation Summary: Card Selection & Edge Case Configuration

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of card selection/transfer functionality and comprehensive edge case configuration for the Monopoly Deal Analyzer.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Data Models (`backend/app/models/game.py`)

#### New Edge Case Rules
- **House/Hotel as Payment**: `houseHotelAsPayment` - Controls where buildings go when used as payment
- **Moving House/Hotel**: `movingHouseHotel` - Rules for relocating buildings between sets
- **Deck Exhaustion**: `deckExhaustionReshuffle` - Whether discard pile reshuffles
- **Extra Properties**: `extraPropertiesHandling` - How overflow properties are managed
- **Property Set Merging**: `mergingPropertySets` - Allow orphaned cards to combine
- **Building Forfeiture**: `forfeitingBuildings` - When buildings are discarded
- **Quadruple Rent**: `quadrupleRent` - Enable/disable double Double Rent cards
- **Forced Deal → Deal Breaker**: `forcedDealToDealBreaker` - Validate sequence
- **Just Say No Empty Hand**: `justSayNoEmptyHand` - Usage with no payment ability

#### New Card Operation Models
- **`CardTransfer`**: Model for moving cards between locations (hand, bank, properties, opponents)
- **`CardSelection`**: Model for selecting multiple cards for operations
- **`CardOperationRequest`**: API request wrapper for card operations
- **`CardOperationResponse`**: API response with operation results and validation

### 2. Enhanced Game Engine (`backend/app/core/game_engine.py`)

#### New Methods
- **`validate_edge_case_rules()`**: Validates game state against configured edge rules
- **`_get_property_set_count()`**: Helper to get required property counts
- **Enhanced edge case validation** for buildings, property sets, and game rules

### 3. New API Endpoint (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/analysis.py`)

#### `POST /card-operation`
- **Purpose**: Handle card transfers, selections, and operations
- **Features**:
  - Validate operations against edge rules
  - Execute card movements between game locations
  - Return updated game state
  - Provide validation error messages

#### Helper Functions
- **`validate_card_operation()`**: Check if operations comply with edge rules
- **`execute_card_operation()`**: Perform the actual card movements
- **`is_valid_property_set()`**: Validate property set combinations

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Card Selection Component (`frontend/src/components/CardSelector.tsx`)

#### Features
- **Card Selection**: Click to select/deselect cards from hand
- **Operation Types**: Transfer, play, or discard cards
- **Target Locations**: Properties, bank, discard pile, or opponents
- **Property Set Selection**: Choose target property set for transfers
- **Opponent Selection**: Target specific opponents for card transfers
- **Edge Rules Display**: Show current edge rule configuration
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid operations based on rules

#### UI Elements
- Operation type dropdown (transfer/play/discard)
- Target location selector
- Property set picker
- Opponent selector
- Interactive card grid with selection states
- Transfer button with validation
- Edge rules summary panel

### 2. Edge Case Configurator (`frontend/src/components/EdgeCaseConfigurator.tsx`)

#### Configuration Sections
- **House/Hotel Rules**: Payment methods and movement rules
- **Deck & Game Rules**: Exhaustion handling and extra properties
- **Property Set Rules**: Merging and building forfeiture
- **Action Card Rules**: Rent stacking, counter sequences, empty hand usage

#### UI Controls
- Dropdown selectors for enum values
- Toggle switches for boolean rules
- Descriptive labels and help text
- Save/Reset buttons for configuration management

### 3. Dashboard Integration (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

#### Tabbed Interface
- **Game Setup**: Current game state and card selector
- **Analysis**: Game analysis features (placeholder)
- **Edge Rules**: Edge case configuration panel

#### Game State Display
- Current player hand, bank, and properties
- Opponent information and status
- Interactive card management
- Real-time state updates

### 4. UI Component Library (`frontend/src/components/ui/`)

#### Components Created
- **Card**: Container with header, content, and footer
- **Button**: Styled button with variants and sizes
- **Badge**: Status and category indicators
- **Select**: Dropdown selection controls
- **Switch**: Toggle controls for boolean values
- **Label**: Form labels with accessibility
- **Tabs**: Tabbed interface navigation

#### Utility Functions
- **`cn()`**: Class name merging utility
- **Tailwind CSS integration** with custom Monopoly Deal theme

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Backend Test Script (`backend/test_card_operations.py`)

#### Test Coverage
- Card transfer operations
- Card selection operations
- Edge rules validation
- Game state analysis
- Configuration testing

### 2. API Testing
- Card operation endpoint validation
- Edge rule enforcement
- Game state updates
- Error handling

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Card Selection & Transfer
- **Hand Management**: Select cards from hand for operations
- **Property Transfers**: Move cards to property sets
- **Bank Operations**: Convert cards to money
- **Opponent Interactions**: Transfer cards between players
- **Multi-card Selection**: Select multiple cards simultaneously

### ✅ Edge Case Configuration
- **Comprehensive Rules**: 15+ configurable edge cases
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate rule checking
- **Flexible Settings**: Support for different house rule variations
- **Visual Interface**: Intuitive configuration panels

### ✅ Game State Management
- **Interactive Updates**: Real-time game state changes
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid moves based on rules
- **State Persistence**: Maintain game state across operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for invalid operations

### ✅ User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use card selection
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear selection states and validation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Proper labeling and keyboard navigation

## Usage Examples

### 1. Transfer Property to Set
```typescript
// Select green property card
// Choose "Properties" as target
// Select "green" property set
// Click "Transfer Selected Cards"
```

### 2. Configure Edge Rules
```typescript
// Navigate to "Edge Rules" tab
// Set "House/Hotel as Payment" to "bank"
// Enable "Quadruple Rent"
// Save configuration
```

### 3. Transfer to Opponent
```typescript
// Select action card
// Choose "Opponent" as target
// Select target opponent
// Execute transfer
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhanced Validation
- Property set combination validation
- Action card sequence validation
- Turn order enforcement

### 2. Game History
- Operation logging
- Undo/redo functionality
- Game state snapshots

### 3. Advanced Analysis
- Move recommendation based on edge rules
- Strategy adaptation to rule variations
- Performance metrics by rule set

### 4. Multiplayer Support

- Rule enforcement across players
- Conflict resolution

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom shadcn/ui implementation

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient game state updates
- Minimal re-renders in React
- Optimized validation algorithms

### Security
- Input validation on all operations
- User authentication for card operations
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
